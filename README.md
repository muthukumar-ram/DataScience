Numpy Notes

Day 0 : 

Today's Progress : I have setup all the things I needed to complete this challenge and also completed chosing the projects I will work on .

1.  Prepared the topics to learn
2.  Signed up MOOCs

Day 1 and 2 : 

1. Practiced Basics of Numpy
2 . creating 1d and nd array
3. Manipulating array shapes
4. Splitting and stacking arrays

Day 3 : 
1. Numpy Copies and Views
2. Few Numpy Attributes

Day 4 :
1. Multi Dimensional Indexing
2. Matrix Computation
3. Math Functions

Day 5 : 

Since I am learning ML, I implemented the Kmeans algorithm
What I learnt
1. Used Misc library to read the image and converting numpy array
2. Reducing 3D array to 2D array for dimensionality reduction
3. Used SKlearn Kmeans Algorithm
4. Plotted the image, changed the no of clusters to see the different results

Day 6 : 
1. Implemented Meshgrid
2. numpy where clause
3. numpy sum,cumsum,cumprod
4. Sort
5. Unique

Day 7 : 
1. File Input and Output operation
  a. Load, Save
  b. loadtxt, savetxt
  c. savez, savez_compressed
2. Linear Algebra
  a. Least Square Calculation lsteq
  b. Ploting Line 
  c. Solving Equation (Squared Matrix) ==> solve method
3. seed method in random library

 Day 8 : 
 1. Numpy Eigenvalues and EigenVectors
 2. Dimensionality Reduction
 3. Principal Component Analysis
 4. Implemented PCA for IRIS Data and plotted the data
 5. Face Recognition using PCA, Logistic Regression
